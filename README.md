# Service Broker for CoreOS Etcd

This project gives users of a Cloud Foundry installation access to slices of a shared CoreOS etcd deployment.

This project does not describe the deployment of etcd. Consider https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/etcd-release/ as one way to bring up single- and multi-node etcd clusters with or without https support.
